# Probability of Ruin

This project aims to evaluate the probability of ruin in an insurance company by modeling claims and their costs. Various distributions are used to model claim costs, including negative binomial, exponential, and log-normal distributions. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the extreme quantiles of the total claim costs.
